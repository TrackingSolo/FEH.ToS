<p>
    ForeverHome is an app that assists users to find lakeside homes in all 50
    states and bookmark them. I hope you enjoy ForeverHome and if you’d like to
    share properties with your friends and/ family, let me know and I’ll add
    them as a tester!

    Getting Started
</h3>
<p>
    When you open ForeverHome for the first time, you will be prompted to enter
    your display name. This is the name your Friends &amp; Family group members
    will see when you share properties with them. You will also be asked to sign
    in with your Google account, which enables syncing your properties to the
    cloud so they are never lost. This means you can use ForeverHome on
    different devices but don’t worry, you can always delete you account in the
    Admin tab.
</p>
<h3>
    Adding Properties:
</h3>
<p>
    <img
        width="195"
        height="147"
        src="file:///C:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png"
        align="right"
        hspace="12"
        vspace="5"
        alt="Text Box: Note that this is a BETA testing phase – FOREVERHOME is optimized for Zillow until I can get to the others."
    />
    ForeverHome works alongside the real estate apps you already use — Zillow,
    Redfin, Realtor.com, Trulia, and others.
</p>
<p>
    To add a property to ForeverHome:
</p>
<p>
    1. Open your real estate app and find a property you want to bookmark.
</p>
<p>
    2. Tap the Share button on that listing.
</p>
<p>
    3. Select ForeverHome from the share sheet. You may have to click “More” and
    select from ForeverHome from there.
</p>
<p>
    ForeverHome will automatically extract the address, price, beds, baths,
    square footage, and listing URL. The app will switch to your Favorites tab
    and the property will appear there immediately. In the background,
    ForeverHome geocodes the address and identifies the nearest lake.
</p>
<p>
    If you share the same property again later (for example, when the price
    changes), ForeverHome will update the existing record rather than create a
    duplicate.
</p>
<p>
    Now, lets get started with the four tabs at the top of ForeverHome …
</p>
<h3>
    <img
        width="191"
        height="318"
        src="file:///C:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.png"
        align="right"
        hspace="12"
    />
    The Four Tabs:
</h3>
<h4>
    Selection tab
</h4>
<p>
    The Selection tab gives you a geographic overview of all the properties you
    have rated. Properties are grouped by Tier, then state. You might ask “What
    the heck is a tier and why do I need it?” Great question! ForeverHome is
    designed with an eye on taxes and specifically for taxes Veteran retirees
    might have to pay. The Tiers are simply my ranking of the most retirement,
    tax-friendly states.
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="656"
        height="775"
        src="file:///C:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.png"
        alt="Text Box: WARNING: Don’t read if tax and math stuff bores you!
Tiers and my calculus:
Specifically, states in Tier one either don’t have any taxes or they don’t tax the following: 
1. States that don't have a state tax
2. 22 states that don’t tax military retirement pay
3. Don’t tax pension
4. Don’t tax TSP distributions (a military and government 401k)
5. Don't tax Social Security pensions.

However, some states (I’m looking at you New Hampshire) have higher property tax rates to offset no state taxes so you have to account for property tax rates. Moreover, you have to also account for the following:
1) Tax Break Rank
2) State Cost of Living Rank: Cost of living Indices
3) RE Tax Rank: Effective Real-Estate Tax Rate, Annual Taxes on $300K Home, Annual Taxes for State Median, and State Median Home Value
4) State Sales Tax: State Sales Tax %
5) Total Tax Burden: Tax Burden Rank (overall tax rate in a given state)

All said-and-done, you have to weigh what is most important to have in your retirement state. Ultimately, I prioritized the 3 factors: 
1) Tax break rankings
2) State Cost of Living
3) Total Tax Burden

So, to answer your question about Tiers, I prioritized by the 3 items above and came up with a 1-50 ranking of states. I then broke them into Tiers. Since I weighed Tax breaks the most heavily, states in Tier 1 (as stated above) either don’t have any taxes or they don’t tax income Veterans (and other retirees) may get. Tier 2 have 4 of the tax breaks but they still tax 1 of the 5 pension income sources listed above. (Note that the 1 income that is taxed could be any of the 5 – if differs from state to state.) States in Tier 3 have 3 of the tax breaks but they still tax 2 of the 5 pension income sources listed above. Etc.

    <br clear="ALL"/>
</p>
<p>
    ForeverHome provides a list of each state (by tiers) and shows a count of
    how many rated properties you have there. Tap a state to expand it and see
    the individual properties listed.
</p>
<p>
    Tapping any property from the state list opens the Property Detail overlay.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a member of a Friends &amp; Family group and have a group
    selected, the Selection tab will show only properties associated with that
    group.
</p>

        align="right"
        hspace="12"
    />
    Favorites tab
</h4>
<p>
    The Favorites tab shows all of your rated properties in a scrollable list,
    sorted by lakes.
</p>
<p>
    Each property summary card shows:
</p>
<p>
    - Property address and photo thumbnail
</p>
<p>
    - Price, beds, baths, and square footage
</p>
<p>
    - Your rating
</p>
<p>
    - A sentiment line showing all group members' ratings (e.g., Jason: 8 |
    Christina: 6)
</p>
<p>
    Tapping a card opens the Property Detail overlay.
</p>
<p>
    Like the Selection tab, the Favorites tab gives you options to filter by.
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="700"
        height="369"
        src="file:///C:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.png"
        alt="Text Box: Property Detail (PD)
You get to a property’s details by tapping any property from any property summary card. This is where you get to take your notes, see notes about nearby locations, and take and pass notes.
Remember to use the slider to assign a rating from 1 to 10 (ten being the best). This rating determines whether the property is shared with your group (only rated properties sync to Friends &amp; Family) 

Notes
Tap the Initial Impressions or Additional Notes field to open the notes dialog. Initial Impressions are limited to 50 characters — a quick headline thought. Additional Notes are unlimited and support multiple lines.

Notes from your Friends &amp; Family group members appear in the same timeline, sorted newest first, so you can see the full conversation history about a property in one place.

"

    <br clear="ALL"/>
</p>
<h4>
    Shared Favorites tab
</h4>
<p>
    The Shared Favorites tab is the collaboration hub for your Friends &amp;
    Family group.
</p>
<p>
    Here you can:
</p>
<p>
    - Select a group from the dropdown at the top of the screen
</p>
<p>
    - Sync to push your latest rated properties to the group and pull down your
    group members' properties
</p>
<p>
    - See properties organized into two sections:
</p>
<p>
    1.      Not yet rated — properties your friends and family have shared with
    you that you haven’t yet rated (yellow background)
</p>
<p>
    2.      All properties rated by you and other group members
</p>
<p>
    Syncing happens automatically in the background. You can also tap the Sync
    button to trigger an immediate sync. When a group member adds or updates a
    property, your SF tab will refresh automatically in real time.
</p>
<p>
    To create a new group or invite someone, use the invite controls on this
    tab. Once a member accepts, you will both be able to see each other's rated
    properties.
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="672"
        height="385"
        src="file:///C:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image009.png"
        alt="Text Box: Groups and Friends &amp; Family Collaboration

ForeverHome is designed for couples and families making a major home decision together. Here is the typical flow:
1. One person creates a group from the SF tab and shares an invite link with their partner or family member.
2. Each person uses ForeverHome independently — browsing listings, importing properties, rating them, and adding notes.
3. When either person syncs, rated properties from both members appear in the Shared Favorites tab for everyone in the group.
4. On every property card across all tabs, a sentiment line shows how all group members have rated that property, making it easy to identify properties where everyone agrees.
5. Tapping into a property's detail shows the full notes timeline with entries from all members, labeled by name, so you can read each person's reactions and thoughts in context.

<h4>
    Admin tab
</h4>
<p>
    The Admin tab is where you manage your account settings and financial
    defaults.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>User Financials</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Set the default values used to calculate monthly mortgage estimates across
    all properties:
</p>
<p>
    - Interest Rate — Defaults to 7.0%. Enter your current rate or the rate you
    are shopping for.
</p>
<p>
    - Loan Term — Defaults to 30 years.
</p>
<p>
    - Down Payment — Defaults to 20%.
</p>
<p>
    - Veteran Status — If you check this box, ForeverHome will calculate your
    property tax as $0, reflecting the tax exemption available to many Veterans.
</p>
<p>
    These settings persist across sessions and apply automatically whenever you
    open a property.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Groups</strong>
</p>
<p>
    View all groups you belong to and leave any group from this section.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Testing (developer tools)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Contains utilities for resetting data during testing, including clearing all
    properties and fixing data inconsistencies. These are not intended for
    regular use.
